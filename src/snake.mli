(** A [t] represents a snake on the board.

    Snake is a mutable type, so when we make changes to it, the functions return
    unit.  They affect the internal state of the snake, rather than making a new
    snake. *)
type t [@@deriving sexp_of]

(** Used for pretty-printing snake contents for tests. *)
val to_string : ?indent:int -> t -> string

(** [create] makes a new snake with the given length. The length must be
    positive.

    The snake will initially be occupy the (column, row) locations:
    (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ..., (length - 1, 0)

    The head will be at position (length - 1, 0) and the initial direction
    should be towards the right. *)
val create               : length:int -> t
val create_multiplayer   : length:int -> board:Board.t -> t array
(** [grow_over_next_steps t n] tells the snake to grow by [n] in length over
    the next [n] steps. *)
val grow_over_next_steps : t -> int -> unit

(** [tail] returns the current locations that the snake's body occupies, excluding the
    head. The first element of the list is the tail of the snake. [tail] can be empty *)
val tail                 : t -> Position.t list

(** [head] returns the location of the snake's head. *)
val head                 : t -> Position.t

(** [all_locations] returns the current locations that the snake occupies *)
val all_locations        : t -> Position.t list

(** [set_direction] tells the snake to move in a specific direction the next
    time [step] is called. *)
val set_direction        : t -> Direction.t -> unit

(** [direction] returns the current direction the snake is facing *)
val direction            : t -> Direction.t

(** [step] moves the snake forward by 1. [step] returns false if the snake collided
    with itself. *)
val step                 : t -> bool

(** Functions in [Exercises] modules shouldn't be used.  They are only exposed so they
    can be tested *)
