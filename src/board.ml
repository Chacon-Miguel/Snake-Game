(* Exercise 03a:

   This module is a simple record that represent the parameters of the board. It is a
   record with two fields, [height] and [width].

   Our goal is to write the [in_bounds] function which given a board, and a position, will
   return true or false based on if the position is in the board.

   The [Position.t] is a record that contains two fields. Take a look at the signature in
   position.mli to see that type.

   Because we use 0 indexing, the bottom left corner of the board is (0,0) and the top
   right is (width-1,height-1).

   Some hints:
   - >, >=, <, <= are the int comparison operators
   - && is how to represent boolean "and"
   - the following is a boolean statement whose value is true:
   {[
     3 < 5
   ]}

   Once the tests for 03a are passing, let's go to game.ml to finish up collision
   detection. *)
let in_bounds t { Position.row; col } =
  ignore t;
  ignore row;
  ignore col;
  0 <= row && row < t.height && 0 <= col && col < t.width
;;

let all_locations t =
  List.concat_map (List.range 0 t.height) ~f:(fun row ->
    List.map (List.range 0 t.width) ~f:(fun col -> { Position.row; col }))
;;
